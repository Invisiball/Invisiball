				<p>
					Unforunately, maintenance has started.
					Don't worry though, it won't take that long!
					Want to know what I do during maintenance?
					First, I stop all games, connections, and loading pages.
					Then I re-sort the user database.
					If everything goes, well, I send the maintenance log to the admin.
					Want to see exactly what I'm doing?
					Click this <a href="https://github.com/usandfriends/Invisiball/blob/master/server.js#L500">link</a> to find out!</p>
